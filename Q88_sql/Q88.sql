"""
Given the following dataset, can you write a SQL query that returns the top 3 performing ad groups each day?

Here we'll define performance as the ratio between revenue and spend (e.g. revenue / spend). 
In other words, the higher the ratio the better the peformance. 
The output of the query will be the date and an array of the ad groups.
